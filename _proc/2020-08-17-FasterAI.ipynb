    "Knowledge distillation is a simple yet very efficient way to train a model. It was introduced in 2006 by [Caruana et al.](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~caruana/compression.kdd06.pdf){% fn 1 %}. The main idea behind is to use a small model (called the **student**) to approximate the function learned by a larger and high-performing model (called the **teacher**). This can be done by using the large model to pseudo-label the data. This idea has been used very recently to [break the state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04252){% fn 2 %}.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train our model for classification, we usually use a softmax as last layer. This softmax has the particularity to squish low value logits towards **0**, and the highest logit towards **1**. This has for effect to completely lose all the inter-class information, or what is sometimes called the *dark knowledge*. This is the information that is valuable and that we want to transfer from the teacher to the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we still use a regular classification loss but at the same time, we'll use another loss, computed between the *softened* logits of the teacher (our *soft labels*) and the *softened* logits of the student (our *soft predictions*). Those soft values are obtained when you use a **soft-softmax**, that avoids squishing the values at its output. Our implementation follows [this paper](http://cs230.stanford.edu/files_winter_2018/projects/6940224.pdf){% fn 3 %} and the basic principle of training is represented in the figure below:"

    "**Batch Normalization Folding** is a really easy to implement and straightforward idea. The gist is that batch normalization is nothing more than a normalization of the input data at each layer. Moreover, at inference time, the batch statistics used for this normalization are fixed. We can thus incorporate the normalization process directly in the convolution by changing its weights and completely remove the batch normalization layers, which is a gain both in terms of parameters and in terms of computations. For a more in-depth explaination, see my [previous post](https://nathanhubens.github.io/posts/deep%20learning/2020/04/20/BN.html). \n",
